Creation of Slice in Go
  - Go creates an array
  - Go creates a structure that records the length (number of content), capacity (max capacity of the slice),
  - reference to the array.

Go is a PASS BY VALUE language.

-----------Maps---------------

Map = key & value pairs.
Keys in a map have to be in the same type. Values have to be in the same type.
